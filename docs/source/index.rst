El Greco: Graphical model compiler.
===================================

El Greco is a graphical models compiler which performs Gibbs sampling. When it
is completed, it will be written in Python, but models will be automatically
compiled to C(++) behind the scenes so that they run fast.

The main focus is to provide LDA-type models.
